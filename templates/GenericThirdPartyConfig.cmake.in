# This is a minimal config file template used to make third-party libraries
# downloaded via FetchContent findable with find_package() after installation.
# Only used for simple third-party dependencies that don't provide their own
# CMake config files (e.g., header-only libraries without install() commands).

@PACKAGE_INIT@

# Include the targets file we generated for this simple third-party library.
# Complex libraries with dependencies will self-install their own configs.
